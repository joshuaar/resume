\section{Profile}
I'm a scientist with training in computer science, statistics, and biology. I work with high dimensional data on clustering, classification and modeling problems for disease diagnostics. Computing to me is a hobby as well as a profession, and I constantly work on improving my skills through reading and contributing to open source projects. I seek and would thrive in an interdiciplinary, team oriented and technical environment. See github (\link{https://github.com/joshuaar}) or linkedin (\link{https://linkedin.com/in/joshuaar}) for more details.

\section{Skills}
\cventry{}{Analytical Skills}{}{Experience in supervised and unsupervised machine learning, genomics data analysis, high dimensional data, multivariate and nonparametric statistics, data visualization in R and Python}{}{}
\cventry{}{Languages}{}{Python, R, Scala, Java, C++, Javascript}{}{}
\cventry{}{Software/Libraries}{}{Linux, Apache Lucene, Vim, Git, Illustrator}{}{}

\section{Experience}
\cventry{02.2014-Present}{USDA Agricultural Research Service}{Bioinformatics Specialist}{Maricopa, AZ}{}{
Run a small informatics core facility focusing primarily on \textbf{RNA-Seq} transcriptomics in insects. 
\newline
- Built a \textbf{web interface} exposing tools for parallel processing of genomics data to research scientists.
\newline
- \textbf{Designed an analysis pipeline} available on Galaxy for de-novo transcriptome assembly, annotation, searching and visualization. Used by three participating research groups.
\newline
- Support and parallelization of FORTRAN code for radiative transfer atmospheric models.
}

\cventry{2010-Present}{Biodesign Institute}{Research Associate}{Tempe, AZ}{}{
Conduct research projects involving high density \textbf{peptide microarrays}. Design experiments, \textbf{algorithms and software} geared toward turning this technology into a \textbf{universal disease diagnostic} called Immunosignaturing (\link{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosignature}).  
\newline
- Designed and tested a system for rapidly mapping B-Cell epitopes from human sera and monoclonal antibodies. Includes a novel \textbf{statistical algorithm} for epitope determination from noisy sequence data.
\newline
- Designed and built a rapid pattern search engine for biological sequences using \textbf{Apache Lucene and Scala}. It is over 100x faster than naive methods, and useful for identifying peptide motifs in large sequence databases. Includes \textbf{trigram index, pattern compiler, web interface}.
\newline
- Wrote non-parametric (bootstrapping) validation procedures for a an immunosignature based Dengue Fever diagnostic. Includes \textbf{feature selection, SVM classification, cross validation, ROC analysis} and visualization. I packaged this into a command line application which became standard protocol in the lab.
\newline
- Assorted infrastructure work - SQL database design, data warehousing, organization and retrieval. \textbf{PostgreSQL Database} and web interface for storing, cleaning and retrieving \textbf{high throughput peptide microarray} data.
\newline
}

\cventry{2009-2010}{Entech}{Quality Control Engineer}{White Pigeon, MI}{}{
Directed quality control for a recycling plant specializing in tire rubber for artificial turf, molding and extrusion.
\newline
- Built and supported a database for QC results with \textbf{nightly backups to offsite storage}.
\newline
- Wrote procedures creating formatted reports for management.
\newline
- Technologies used: PostgreSQL, Python, Excel
\newline
- Ensured data and product samples were available and accurate, which was important for occasional disputes over quality.
}

\cventry{01.2009-07.2009}{University of Notre Dame}{Research Visitor}{Notre Dame, IN}{}{
Research internship at UND in the lab of Dr. Paul Helquist. Synthesized TSA analogs for treatment of Niemann-Pick disease, co-authoring two papers in peer reviewed journals.
}
