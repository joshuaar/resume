\section{Profile}
I analyze high dimensional data, quantify what is known and deliver insights into that which is unknown. I develop robust machine learning methods for diagnostics and analysis pipelines for transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq). A proficient linux user and software developer at work and at home, I am active in open source projects and love learning new things about computing. See github (\link{https://github.com/joshuaar}) or linkedin (\link{https://linkedin.com/in/joshuaar}) for more details.

\section{Experience}
\cventry{02.2014-Present}{USDA Agricultural Research Service}{Bioinformatics Specialist}{Maricopa, AZ}{}{
Run a small bioinformatics core facility focusing primarily on \textbf{RNA-Seq} transcriptomics in insects. Significant projects include:
\newline
- Antennal transcriptome profiling for olfactory receptors and odorant binding proteins (manuscript under preparation)
\newline
- An analysis pipeline available on \textbf{Galaxy} for de-novo transcriptome \textbf{assembly, annotation, searching and visualization}. Used by three participating research groups.
\newline
- Support and parallelization of FORTRAN code for radiative transfer atmospheric models.
}

\cventry{2010-Present}{Biodesign Institute}{Research Associate}{Tempe, AZ}{}{
Conduct research projects involving high density peptide microarrays. I design experiments, algorithms and software geared toward turning this technology into a universal disease diagnostic called Immunosignaturing (\link{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosignature}).  
\newline
- Designed and tested a system for rapidly mapping B-Cell epitopes from human sera and monoclonal antibodies. Includes a novel \textbf{statistical algorithm} for epitope determination from noisy sequence data (Manuscript submitted to Molecular and Cellular Proteomics).
\newline
- Designed and built a rapid pattern search engine for biological sequences using \textbf{Apache Lucene and Scala}. It is over 100x faster than naive methods, and useful for identifying peptide motifs in large sequence databases. Includes \textbf{trigram index, pattern compiler, web interface}.
\newline
- Wrote non-parametric (bootstrapping) validation procedures for a an immunosignature based Dengue Fever diagnostic. Includes \textbf{feature selection, SVM classification, cross validation, ROC analysis} and visualization. I packaged this into a command line application which became standard protocol in the lab.
\newline
- Assorted infrastructure work - SQL schema design, data warehousing, organization and retrieval. \textbf{PostgreSQL Database} and web interface for storing, cleaning and retrieving \textbf{high throughput peptide microarray} data.
\newline
}

\cventry{2009-2010}{Entech}{Quality Control Engineer}{White Pigeon, MI}{}{
Directed quality control for a recycling plant specializing in tire rubber for artifical turf, molding and extrusion.
\newline
- Built and supported a database for QC results with \textbf{nightly backups to offsite storage}.
\newline
- Wrote procedures creating formatted reports for management.
\newline
- Technologies used: PostgreSQL, Python, Excel
\newline
- Ensured data and product samples were available and accurate, which was important for occasional disputes over quality.
}

\cventry{01.2009-07.2009}{University of Notre Dame}{Research Visitor}{Notre Dame, IN}{}{
Research internship at UND in the lab of Dr. Paul Helquist. Synthesized TSA analogs for treatment of Niemann-Pick disease, co-authoring two papers in peer reviewed journals.
}
\cventry{2004-2007}{Helping Hand PC Services and Networking}{Technician}{Saint Charles, IL}{}{
- IT support and web hosting for small business. I worked here over summers while in high school, where I learned about programming and use of linux to manage web servers. Wrote a simple interface for VNC enabling remote IT support for clients.
}
